Key things: I used torch and bert model for phrase extracting for google search.
remove_similar_phrases is the reason of failing

    "Among the towering oaks and sturdy pines, a brook meandered, its waters sparkling like diamonds in the daylight. "
    "It sang a melodic tune as it flowed over smooth stones, nourishing the vibrant life surrounding it. "
    "Flowers of every hue bloomed along its banks, their fragrances mingling in the air, creating a symphony of scents that beckoned to the wandering creatures of the woods. "
    
    "As dusk approached, the forest transformed. The warm hues of sunset faded, replaced by the cool tones of twilight. "
    "Fireflies began to flicker, illuminating the darkness with their tiny, glowing lights. "
    "The chirping of crickets filled the air, and the soft hoots of owls echoed from the treetops. "

    "She was drawn to the beauty around her, her heart racing with excitement. Legends spoke of a hidden glade where the moonlight danced upon a silver pond, and she longed to find it. "
    
    "With each step, she discovered new wondersâ€”a cluster of mushrooms forming a perfect circle, a family of deer grazing peacefully in a clearing, "
    "and the distant call of a wolf breaking the silence. The forest felt alive, as if it were watching her every move, guiding her toward her destiny. "
    
    "Finally, as the last rays of sunlight disappeared, Elara stumbled upon the glade. The moon hung high, casting a silvery glow on the pond, "
